# Music Bands
Create an application that displays a list of music bands and their music. 
The application will consist of three main screens:
- Bands Screen: A UITableView displaying a list of music bands. Each table cell should show the band's name.
- Albums Screen: When selecting a band on the Bands Screen, a new screen will appear with a UITableView displaying a list of albums from that band. Each table cell should display the album's title and release year.
- Songs Screen: Upon selecting an album on the Albums Screen, a third screen will appear with a UITableView displaying the list of songs from that album. Each table cell should show the song's name and duration.

## Requirements:
- Create a data structure to represent bands, albums, and songs (e.g., using classes or structures in Swift).
- Display the list of bands on the Bands Screen.
- Show the list of albums from the selected band on the Albums Screen.
- Display the list of songs from the selected album on the Songs Screen.
- Implement navigation between screens using the UINavigationController navigation system.
- Customize table cells to display relevant and appealing information, such as band images or album covers.
- Implement back navigation to allow users to return to the previous screen.
